   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Home
=============

Home is meant as the user interface of the cluster where
minor files and local libraries could be kept. Shouldn't contain
large files like simulations as this could slow down all the system

The current space is:

    - Capacity: 117G  
    - Occupied : 35GB  
    - Available: 78GB 
    - Usage : 31%

Under **/home/<user_name>** each user has his own private folder
