Water Block in Pele++ control file
====================================


Methodology
-------------

Explanation of the used methodology (we can re-used the waterMC paper)
and how many waters to use and how much time adds up to the computation

Location
--------

The Water block must be defined inside the PeleSimulation command as
shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: json

commands : [
     "commandType": "peleSimulation" {
     ...
"WaterPerturbation":
         {
             "Box" :
             {
                 "radius" : {},
                 "fixedCenter": [{}],
                 "type" : "sphericalBox"
             },
             "watersToPerturb": { "links": { "ids": [ {} ] } },
             "parameters":
             {
                 "temperature": {},
                 "numberOfStericTrials": {},
                 "COMConstraintConstant": {}
             }
         }, 
       ...
       }
   ]


Options and parameters
----------------------

.. _sec-solvent-solventType:

Box
^^^^^^^^^^^

Uses: It sets the exploration box for the waters (only spherical box is allowed)

refer to: Box section for more information


watersToPerturbPerStep
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uses: It sets the number of waters to be perturb at the same time in each water perturbation step.

Default value: -1 (all of them)


translationRange
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use: It sets the amplitude of the translation of the water molecules in each steps in angstroms.

Default value: 1.0


overlapFactor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use: It sets the overlap factor for the water molecule. For more refer to: Overlapfactor section

Default value: 0.8


temperature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use: It sets the temperature value of the water simulation

Default value: 1000

temperature info: Any info on optimal valuess and how does it affect??


numberOfStericTrial
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use: It sets the number of steric trials in each water perturbation step. For
more please refer to: steric trial section

Default value: 100


COMConstraintConstant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use: It sets a constraint on the water molecule after being perturb. For more refer to: COM section

Default value: 0
