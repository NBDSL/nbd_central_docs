The basics on PELE analysis to run after the simulation is finished.


**************************
Plot metrics
**************************

AdaptivePELE (within the PelePlatform) and Gnuplot is need it. To run from inside the results folder.

Explanation::

    python -m AdaptivePELE.analysis.plotAdaptive steps column_x (starting by 1) column_y  basename_of_report -points -zcol column_z (colorbar)  | gnuplot -p

Example::

    python -m AdaptivePELE.analysis.plotAdaptive 8 5 6 run_report_ -points -zcol 4 | gnuplot -p

Output:

.. image:: gnuplot.png

*****************************************
Retrieve the snapshots with best energy
*****************************************

AdaptivePELE (within PelePlatform) is need it. To run from inside the results folder.

Explanation::

    python -m AdaptivePELE.analysis.interactivePlot  columny columnx steps -o output_folder

Example::

    python AdaptivePELE.analysis.interactivePlot  5 6 8 -o BestStructs

Once the plot is done with your left button mouse drag a square on the plot containing the structures you want to be downloaded as shown in Figure below.


.. image:: interactivePlot.png
    :align: center


This will output all snapshots contain in the square in a folder called BestStructs.


********************************************
Extract the movie of your best snapshot
********************************************

AdaptivePELE is need it.

Once you did the interactivePlot you may want to have the entrance path of your best selected structure. For this you must run:

Explanation::

    python AdaptivePELE.analysis.backtrackAdaptiveTrajectory  epoch trajectory step

Example::

    python AdaptivePELE.analysis.backtrackAdaptiveTrajectory  5 123 1
