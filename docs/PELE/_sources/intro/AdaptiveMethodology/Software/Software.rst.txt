AdaptivePELE is a Python module to perform enhancing sampling of molecular simulation built around the Protein Energy Landscape Exploration method (PELE) developed in the Electronic and Atomic Protein Modelling grop (EAPM) at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). For more information about the method refer to the paper. DOI  10.1038/s41598-017-08445-5

AdaptivePELE is called with a control file as a parameters. The control file is a json document that contains 4 sections: general parameters, simulation parameters, clustering parameters and spawning parameters. The first block refers to general parameters of the adaptive run, while the other three blocks configure the three steps of an adaptive sampling run, first run a propagation algorithm (simulation), then cluster the trajectories obtained (clustering) and finally select the best point to start the next iteration (spawning).

Requirements
**********************************

To start a simulation you must have:

    - Comercial PELE installed. Send and e-mail to: daniel.soler@nostrumbiodiscovery.com
    - AdaptivePELE installed. Check the `AdaptivePELE installation <https://adaptivepele.github.io/AdaptivePELE/Examples.html#installation>`__.
    - Prepared the receptor with OPLS atom typing. Check the `Protein Preparation <../SystemPreparation/SystemPreparation.html#receptor-preparation>`__  section.
    - Prepared a DataLocal folder with the parameters of your ligand. Check the `Ligand Preparation <../SystemPreparation/SystemPreparation.html#ligand-preparation>`__  section.
    - Prepated a AdaptivePELE Control File. Check the `Control File <../Simulation/Simulation.html#Input>`_ section.
    - Prepared a PELE Control File. Check the `Control File <../Simulation/Simulation.html#Input>`__ section.
