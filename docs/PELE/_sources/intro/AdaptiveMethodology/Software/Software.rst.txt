AdaptivePELE is a Python module to perform enhanced sampling simulations using the Protein Energy Landscape Exploration method (PELE) developed by the Electronic and Atomic Protein Modelling group (EAPM) at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC).
. For more information about the method, please refer to the paper. DOI  10.1038/s41598-017-08445-5

AdaptivePELE is called with a control file as input. The control file is a json document that contains 4 sections: general parameters, simulation parameters, clustering, and spawning parameters. The first block refers to general parameters of the adaptive run, while the other three blocks configure the three steps of an adaptive sampling run. First a propagation algorithm is run (simulation), then the clusters of the trajectories are obtained (clustering), and finally the best point to start the next iteration is selected (spawning).

Requirements
**********************************

To start a simulation you must have:

    - Commercial PELE installed. Send and e-mail to: daniel.soler@nostrumbiodiscovery.com
    - AdaptivePELE installed. Check the `AdaptivePELE installation <https://adaptivepele.github.io/AdaptivePELE/Examples.html#installation>`__.
    - Prepared the receptor with OPLS atom types. Check the `Protein Preparation <../SystemPreparation/SystemPreparation.html#receptor-preparation>`__  section.
    - Prepared a DataLocal folder with the parameters of your ligand. Check the `Ligand Preparation <../SystemPreparation/SystemPreparation.html#ligand-preparation>`__  section.
    - Prepated a AdaptivePELE Control File. Check the `Control File <../Simulation/Simulation.html#Input>`_ section.
    - Prepared a PELE Control File. Check the `Control File <../Simulation/Simulation.html#Input>`__ section.
