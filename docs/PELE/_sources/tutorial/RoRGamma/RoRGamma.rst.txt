RoRγ: Dissociation Pathway
###################################

Retinoic-acid related-orphan-receptor-C (RORC or RORγ) belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily. It plays a fundamental role in the maturation of IL-17 producing Th17 cells and thus is an attractive target for a variety of autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. RORγ features a multidomain structure characterized by an N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) capable of binding ligands and recruiting co-activator or co-repressor proteins. The LBD is compact globular structure rich in α-helices. Its ligand-binding site is located deeply at the core of the domain. Inspection of all co-crystal structures does not reveal an obvious entry path for this deep buried site. An interesting and unresolved question remains related to how RORγ-LBD active compounds diffuse in and out of the binding site, which is at the core of the LBD.

***********
Objective
***********

To explore the exit pathway of ligand from the protein-ligand bound complex.

**************
Preparation
**************

To start the simulation we need complex, ligand, ligand parameters and the input controlfile.

Receptor
==========

PDB code: 5VB7 processes the protein complex with Protein Preparation Wizard (Schrodinger Program Suite) at pH 7.4 ±0.5 to assign the protonation state to all ionizable residue as well as optimize the H-bond network.


Ligand
=========

Processed with LigPrep module in Schrodinger Program Suite to assign protonation state at pH 7.4 ± 0.5 and tautomerization of the molecule. ESP charges is obtained from single-point calculation at MO6/6-31G** level of theory calculation within Jaguar software.

Template of ligand
=====================

Output a mae file only cointaining the ligand, then run that one through PlopRotTemp.py as explain `here <../../intro/SystemPreparation/SystemPreparation.html#ligand-preparation>`__ to obtain the parameters and rotamers of the ligand and place them on the DataLocal Folder as specified `here <../../molecularParameters.html#adding-the-generated-template-and-rotamer-library-files-to-pele>`_.


********************************************
Procedure: PELE Exit Path
********************************************

Main Charachteristic of the simulation
========================================

- Using the starting structure from protein-ligand crystal complex.     
- AdaptivePELE mode: "Unbinding". This will move the ligand towards the bulk little by little
- Processors: 20 processors
- Compute time: 1-2 hours

ControlFile specifics
==========================

Special required parameters for exit simulation are:

Unbinding Mode and exit Condition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: json


    {
    "simulation": {
        "type" : "pele",
        "params" : {
            "iterations" : 25,
            "processors" : 20,
            "peleSteps" : 5,
            "seed": 67890,
            "controlFile" : "pele.conf",
            "runEquilibration": true,
            "modeMovingBox" : "unbinding",
            "exitCondition" : {
                "type" : "metricMultipleTrajectories",
                "params" : {
                    "metricCol" : 4,
                    "exitValue" : 0.9,
                    "condition" : ">",
                    "numberTrajectories" : 5
    }}}},
    }

Where:

“runEquilibration": true is a keyword to run equilibration before  starting the exit simulation by means of a short minimization involving all the residues and -sidechain within 4 Å from the lingand.

"modeMovingBox" : "unbinding" is a keyword to define a type of “box” as unbinding type. This “box” is defined to limit ligand perturbation within 7 Å from the center-of-mass of ligand and dynamically moved along the ligand position during exit simulation.


.. code-block:: json

    {
     "exitCondition" : {
          "type" : "metricMultipleTrajectories",
          "params" : {
          "metricCol" : 6,
          "exitValue" : 0.9,
          "condition" : ">",
          "numberTrajectories" : 5}
          },
    }

These parameters are to define the exit condition where to stop the simulation if at least 5 trajectories ("numberTrajectories": 5) have the SASA value of ligand more than 0.9 (metricCol" : 6 defined as the matrix column number 6 in the “pele.cof”, "condition" : ">", "exitValue" : 0.9).

Metrics
+++++++++++

Distance between importat residue HID479:NE2 of receptor and Ligand O2 atoms tracked.

.. code-block:: json
   
    {
    "metrics" : [
    { "type": "com_distance",
    "selection_group_1": { "atoms": { "ids": ["A:479:_NE2"] } },
    "selection_group_2": { "atoms": { "ids": ["L:602:_O2_"] } },
    "tag": "distance"
    },
    ]
    }


Results
==============

Exit Plot
+++++++++++

To monitor exiting progress of ligand from its binding site by measuring distance between HID479:NE2 and ligand O2 atoms, as defined in the "com_distance" as "tag": "distance" (column number 7 in run_report file)

Exit Path Important Residues
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To map the residues movement along the ligand exit pathway from the trajectory
make the movie as described `here <../../intro/AdaptiveMethodology/GeneralAnalysis/GeneralAnalysis.html#extract-the-movie-of-your-best-snapshot>`__ and plot all the residues close to the ligand of all snapshots together to see their fluctuation as seen in the Figure below.
