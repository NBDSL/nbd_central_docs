Hemagglutinin: Pocket Detection
###################################


3- Flu hemagglutinin: It is one of the two proteins found on the surface of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin A (HA) is an antigenic glycoprotein assembled as a homo-trimer of identical subunits that are formed of two disulfide-linked polypeptides: membrane-distal HA1 and the smaller, membrane-proximal, HA2. HA is responsible for host cell binding and subsequent fusion of viral and host membranes in the endosome after the virus has been taken up by endocytosis.

It’s been identified a series of inhibitors that bind on the surface of hemagglutinin, both cyclic and linear. Additional structural information is also available of the target when bound to an antibody (Fig 21)

***********
Objective
***********

The goal was to predict the binding mode of JNJ4796 to a structure of hemagglutinin which is not accommodated to bind JNJ4796. For this, the structure found in PDB entry 5W6T (bound to a cyclic peptide) was taken for induced fit PELE simulations.  Can PELE find the binding site and then the correct binding mode by doing a 2-step procedure: Global exploration + local refinement

**************
Preparation
**************

Receptor
==========

5W6T processed with Protein Preparation Wizard (Schrodinger) 
Of note, no crystal structure of the protein with JNJ4796 bound is available in the pdb, so the reference interactions were defined in terms of distance to the residues that are pictured in Fig 21.

Ligand
=========

Processed with LigPrep. Calculate protonation state at pH 7,4±0,5 + ESP charges obtained with Jaguar single-point (DFT/M06) calculation. Of note, the C-ring predicted to be neutral. 

Template of ligand
=====================

Output a mae file only cointaining the ligand, then run that one through PlopRotTemp.py as explain `here <../../intro/SystemPreparation/SystemPreparation.html#ligand-preparation>`__ to obtain the parameters and rotamers of the ligand and place them on the DataLocal Folder as specified `here <../../molecularParameters.html#adding-the-generated-template-and-rotamer-library-files-to-pele>`_.

With the InverselyProportional type  the next iteration of PELE will start from the less represented clusters. Together with continuos density which assigns increasing densities for an increasing number of contacts, **we will emphasize unexplored areas with high number of contacts**.  Finally, set temperature to 1000 to have a standard montecarlo acceptance of 30-40%.

simulation
+++++++++++++

Set a long simulation (iterations:100)  with just a few pele steps per iteration (peleSteps: 4). As we are not interested in an induce fit (many more steps) but on jumping from one area to the other as fast as possible to explore the complete energy landscape. Set a large number of processors (processors: 250) to ensure enough exploration.

    {"simulation": {

        "params" : {
            "iterations" : 100,

            "controlFile" : "./pele_VG.conf"
        }},}

clustering
++++++++++++++

On that paragraph of the control file we need to pay attention to the values and conditions of the cluster. We want to have a big value of rmsd for low contacts (values [10] when conditions between [0.0-0.6]) a fairly generous rmsd when having some contacts (values [5] when  conditions between [0.6-1]) and a low rmsd when having many contacts (values [2.5] when conditions >1]. Meaning we will have less but bigger clusters at the areas with no contacts and many  more at the areas with high number of contacts.

    {
    "clustering" : {
        "type" : "rmsd",
        "params" : {

            }
        }
    }


Results
==============

The energy profile for this first initial induced-fit exploration on the whole of the surface of hamagglutinin is found in Fig. 23. As it can be seen, the exploration generates 7 minima, with one of them (point 1) being quite close (ca. 2 Angstroms) to T318. That is, the initial exploration locates the binding site as one of the probable hotspots on the surface of hemagglutinin.

The 7 minima highlighted in Figure 3, which are far apart from one another, were then subjected to a second round of PELE simulations, now in local exploration mode (Fig. 4)

Results
===========

The energy profile for the refinement of the 7 poses can be found in Fig. 6. As it can be seen, the pose that H-bonds to T318 is the one with the lowest interaction energy (-50kcal/mol) as predicted by PELE. The two lowest energy minima are found in Figure 7. The one that corresponds to the lowest energy value is very close to the binding mode described in the paper by JNJ.
