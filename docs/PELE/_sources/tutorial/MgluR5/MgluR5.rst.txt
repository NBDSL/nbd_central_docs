MgluR5: Pose Prediction on GPCRs
#############################################


Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are high-profile G-protein coupled receptors drug targets because of their involvement in several neurological disease states, and mGluR5 in particular is a subtype whose controlled allosteric modulation, both positive and negative, can potentially be useful for the treatment of schizophrenia and relief of chronic pain, respectively.

   MgluR5 system

***********
Objective
***********

The aim of this project is to find the binding pose of MgluR5 complexed with a benzonitrile NAM. 

**************
Preparation
**************

To start the simulation we need complex, ligand, ligand parameters and the input controlfile.

Receptor
==========

PDB: 5cgc. The holo structure with the ligand crystal at the entrance of the GPCR was processed with Protein Preparation Wizard at pH 7.4 (Schrodinger).


Ligand
=========

Calculate protonation state at pH 7.4Â±0.5 with the default OPLS2005 charges.

Template of ligand
=====================

Output a mae file only cointaining the ligand, then run that one through PlopRotTemp.py as explain `here <../../intro/SystemPreparation/SystemPreparation.html#ligand-preparation>`__ to obtain the parameters and rotamers of the ligand and place them on the DataLocal Folder as specified `here <../../molecularParameters.html#adding-the-generated-template-and-rotamer-library-files-to-pele>`_.


********************************************
Procedure: AdaptivePELE Local Exploration
********************************************

Main Charachteristic of the simulation
========================================

- Bias towards the orthosteric site
- Starting pose for PELE Local Exploration (check box definition)
- Processors: 64
- Compute time: 2-3h

ControlFile specifics
==========================

Special required parameters for this simulation are:

Slight bias towards the orthosteric site
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As we know these compunds should bing on a Class A GPCR fashion
we will set a slight bias towards the orthosteric site.

.. code-block:: json

    {"spawning" : {
        "type" : "epsilon",
        "params" : {
            "reportFilename" : "run_report",
            "metricColumnInReport" : 5,
            "epsilon": 0.15,
            "T":1000
    },}



Box definition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Since we hyphotesize the binding site is in between the TMs the box will contain the extracellular loops + the TM domain.

.. code-block:: json

  {"Box": {
    "type": "sphericalBox",
    "radius": 15,
     "fixedCenter": [-24.84, 6.36, 39.73]
      }
  }


Distances to monitor
++++++++++++++++++++++

We monitor the RMSD to the native pose along the simulation

.. code-block:: json

       {    "type": "rmsd",
             "Native": { "path": "NOSTRUM/GPCRnew/5CGC/5CGC_native.pdb" },
             "selection": { "chains": { "names": [ "C" ] } },
             "includeHydrogens": false, "doSuperposition": false, "tag" : "rmsd_lig"
        }



Results
==============

To analyze the simulation we will:

*************************************
1) Plot the Binding Energies vs RMSD
*************************************

Plot the Binding Energies vs RMSD to check whether there is a minima at low RSMDs. To know more about the command, check `here <../../intro/AdaptiveMethodology/GeneralAnalysis/GeneralAnalysis.html#plot-metrics>`__.

   Plot Binding Energy (Y-axis), RMSD to native pose (X_axis) and SASA (Z-axis)

    
*********************************************************
2) Extract the best structures in terms of BE and RMSD
*********************************************************
Extract the best snapshots. For more on extracting the best snapshots with InteractivePlot, plese refere `here <../../intro/          AdaptiveMethodology/GeneralAnalysis/GeneralAnalysis.html#extract-the-best-structures-in-terms-of-be-and-rmsd>`__.

   In blue we have the crystal structure and in brown the pose predicted by PELE

*************************************************
3) Extract a movie from the best structure
*************************************************

To map the movement of residues along the ligand exit pathway, make a movie as described `here <../../intro/AdaptiveMethodology/GeneralAnalysis/GeneralAnalysis.html#extract-the-movie-of-your-best-snapshot>`__ and display all the residues close to the ligand in one Figure to see their fluctuations (see below).
